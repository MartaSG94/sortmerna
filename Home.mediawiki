<h1>SortMeRNA User Manual</h1>
<p>
SortMeRNA is a local sequence alignment tool for filtering, mapping and OTU-picking.
The core algorithm is based on approximate seeds and allows for fast and sensitive analyses
of NGS reads. The main application of SortMeRNA is filtering rRNA from metatranscriptomic data.
Additional applications include OTU-picking and taxonomy assignation available through QIIME v1.9+ http://qiime.org.
SortMeRNA takes as input a file of reads (fasta or fastq format) and one or multiple rRNA
database file(s), and sorts apart aligned and rejected reads into two files specified by the user.
SortMeRNA works with Illumina, 454, Ion Torrent and PacBio data, and can produce SAM and
BLAST-like alignments.
