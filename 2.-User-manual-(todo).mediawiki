=Introduction=

SortMeRNA is a local sequence alignment tool for filtering, mapping and OTU clustering. The core algorithm is based on approximate seeds and allows for fast and sensitive analyses of NGS reads. The main application of SortMeRNA is filtering rRNA from metatranscriptomic data. Additional applications include OTU-picking and taxonomy assignation available through QIIME v1.9+ (http://qiime.org). SortMeRNA takes as input one or two (paired) reads file(s) (fasta/fasta.gz/fastq/fastq.gz), and one or multiple rRNA database file(s), and sorts apart aligned and rejected reads into two files. SortMeRNA works with Illumina, 454, Ion Torrent and PacBio data, and can produce SAM and BLAST-like alignments.

HMMER 3.1b1 and SumaClust v1.0.00 were used to reduce the size of the original databases to the similarity listed in column 2 (%id) of the table above (see /sortmerna/rRNA databases/README.txt for a list of complete steps).

These representative databases were specically made for fast ltering of rRNA. Approximately the same number of rRNA will be ltered using silva-bac-16s-id90 (12802 rRNA) as using Greengenes 97% (99322 rRNA), but the former will run signicantly faster.

id %: members of the cluster must have identity at least this % id with the representative sequence.

Remark: The user must first index the fasta database by using the command indexdb and then filter/map reads against the database using the command sortmerna. 

=Usage=

Note that unlike the previous releases, Sortmerna 4 has a single executable <code>sortmerna</code>. There is no more a separate <code>indexdb</code> command. The user still have a control over the indexing using the <code>sortmerna</code> indexing options.

==Choosing parameters for filtering and read mapping==

In SortMeRNA users have the option to output sequence alignments for their matching rRNA reads in the SAM or BLAST-like formats. Depending on the desired quality of alignments, different parameters must be set. Table 1 presents a guide to setting parameters for most use cases. In all cases, output alignments are always guaranteed to reach the threshold E-value score (default E-value=1). An E-value of 1 signifies that one random alignment is expected for aligning all reads against the reference database. The E-value in SortMeRNA is computed for the entire search space, not per read. 

{| class="wikitable"
| Option                     || Speed  || Description
|-
| rowspan="3" | --num-alignments INT
| Very fast for INT = 1 
| Output the first alignment passing E-value threshold (best choice if only filtering is needed)
|-
| Speed decreases for higher value INT || Higher INT signifies more alignments will be made & output
|-
| Very slow for INT = 0
| All alignments reaching the E-value threshold are reported (this option is not suggested for high similarity rRNA databases, due to many possible alignments per read causing a very large file output)
|-
| rowspan="3"| --best INT
| Fast for INT = 1
| Only one high-candidate reference sequence will be searched for alignments (determined heuristically using a Longest Increasing Sub-sequence of seed matches). The single best alignment of those will be reported
|-
| Speed decreases for higher value INT
| Higher INT signies more alignments will be made, though only the best one will be reported
|-
| Very slow for INT = 0
| All high-candidate reference sequences will be searched for alignments, though only the best one will be reported
